*denote.nvim*	Simple notes for Emacs with an efficient file-naming scheme

==============================================================================
1. Overview                                                  *denote-overview*

NOTE: this is copy-pasted from the denote.el manual, since I think it provides
      the best description on what this plugin intends to do.

Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective note-taking
and file-naming tool for Emacs.

Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme. The file name must offer a clear indication of
what the contents are about, without reference to any other metadata. Denote
basically streamlines the creation of such files or file names while providing
facilities to link between them (where those files are editable).

Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”. It can be used for all
types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs, such as videos.
Naming files in a consistent way makes their filtering and retrieval
considerably easier. Denote provides relevant facilities to rename files,
regardless of file type.

Denote is based on the following core design principles:

Predictability File names must follow a consistent and descriptive naming
convention (The file-naming scheme). The file name alone should offer a clear
indication of what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent to any form
of file that is part of the user’s long-term storage (Renaming files).
Composability Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other packages or
built-in functionality instead of re-inventing functions such as for filtering
or greping. The author of Denote (Protesilaos, aka “Prot”) writes ordinary
notes in plain text (.txt), switching on demand to an Org file only when its
expanded set of functionality is required for the task at hand (Points of
entry). Portability Notes are plain text and should remain portable. The way
Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in the note’s header,
and the links it establishes must all be adequately usable with standard Unix
tools. No need for a database or some specialised software. As Denote develops
and this manual is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how
to do the Denote-equivalent on the command-line. Flexibility Do not assume the
user’s preference for a note-taking methodology. Denote is conceptually
similar to the Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
detailed introduction: https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/. Notes are atomic
(one file per note) and have a unique identifier. However, Denote does not
enforce a particular methodology for knowledge management, such as a
restricted vocabulary or mutually exclusive sets of keywords. Denote also does
not check if the user writes thematically atomic notes. It is up to the user
to apply the requisite rigor and/or creativity in pursuit of their preferred
workflow (Writing metanotes). Hackability Denote’s code base consists of small
and reusable functions. They all have documentation strings. The idea is to
make it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to understand what is
going on and make surgical interventions where necessary (e.g. to tweak some
formatting). In this manual, we provide concrete examples on such user-level
configurations (Keep a journal or diary).

Now the important part… “Denote” is the familiar word, though it also is a
play on the “note” concept. Plus, we can come up with acronyms, recursive or
otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility like:

    Don’t Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The
    Excesses

But we’ll let you get back to work. Don’t Eschew or Neglect your Obligations,
Tasks, and Engagements.

4.1 stevearc/oil.nvim ~

This extension enhances the functionality of `denote` within `oil` filetype
buffers by implementing custom syntax highlighting for the various components
of the Denote file naming convention. It aims to improve the visual clarity
and user experience when navigating and managing Denote files through the Oil
file explorer interface.

To enable, add to your `denote.nvim` configuration the following: >
    opts = {
      ...
      extensions = {
        oil = true
      }
    }
<

The default highlight groups are defined as follows: >
    hi def link DenoteDate      Number
    hi def link DenoteSignature Comment
    hi def link DenoteTitle     Title
    hi def link DenoteKeywords  Special
    hi def link DenoteExtension Comment
<

To overwrite or clear this groups, refer to |highlight|.
